# nlping.ru static mirror

This repository stores an HTTrack snapshot of **nlping.ru** that is being
normalized for Cloudflare Pages. The content now lives directly in the
repository root, so URLs resolve as `/path` instead of `/nlping.ru/path`.
The remaining work focuses on cleaning HTTrack artefacts and converting
legacy Windows-1251 pages to UTF-8 (see `DOROZHNAYA_KARTA.md`).

## Directory layout

The key directories you will interact with are:

- `css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `img/` — shared static assets.
- `_p_http_/` — HTTrack compatibility stubs for legacy redirects.
- `files/`, `rep/`, `player/`, `p/` — downloadable resources, galleries and
  short URLs referenced across the site.
- `memory-bank/`, `DOROZHNAYA_KARTA.md`, `INSTRUKTSIYA_VYPOLNENIYA.md` —
  documentation that tracks the migration roadmap, reminders and operating
  checklists.
- `tools/` — helper scripts for link checking, SEO comparisons and, later,
  re-encoding content to UTF-8.
- `snapshot/`, `logs/`, `artifacts/` — local-only outputs (kept out of git)
  generated by tooling.

## Routine checks

Run the following commands from the repository root to validate structure
and assets after each batch of changes:

```bash
python tools/check_links.py --scope index.html --scope rss/index.html
python tools/check_utf8.py --scope index.html --scope rss/index.html --no-manifest
python -m http.server 8000
```

The link and UTF-8 scripts accept additional `--scope` arguments for the
folders you edit. Keep the generated logs under `logs/` for reference.

## Workflow reminders

1. Stay on the `work` branch (see roadmap instructions) and keep commits
   small.
2. Update `DOROZHNAYA_KARTA.md` with progress notes and the status of each
   roadmap step.
3. After finishing a roadmap stage, prepare a PR from `work` to `main` and
   attach the relevant log files in the description.
4. Before pushing, ensure there are no stray HTTrack folders (`hts-cache/`)
   or macOS metadata files (`.DS_Store`). They are not needed in git.
